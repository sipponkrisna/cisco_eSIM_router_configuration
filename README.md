# cisco_eSIM_router_configuration
The Cisco emulator (eSIM) can be used to program each of the routers in the topology given in Figure 1. Initially you will see that you have to program five routers (identified with A, B, C,  D and E). The basic tasks are:   • Set-up hostname. This uses the hostname command. • Set-up IP addresses and subnet masks for each of the ports. This uses the ip ad- dress command. • Set-up an executive password. This uses the enable secret command. • Set-up login (console) and telnet (vty) passwords. This uses the password and login commands. • Set-up a routing protocol. This uses the network command. • Set-up a hosts name table. This uses the ip host command. • Show the status of the ports, and the running configuration. The command used for these are show protocols and show running-config.
